# Predictive Maintenance with NASA CMAPSS Dataset

## Project Overview
This project develops a predictive maintenance solution for jet engines using the NASA CMAPSS (Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation) dataset.  
The objective is to predict the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of engines from multivariate sensor data and demonstrate a full **end-to-end ML workflow**.

This project is designed to be portfolio-ready and highlight skills across:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering  
- ML model development (regression + classification)  
- Reproducibility, versioning, and modular code organisation  
- Experiment tracking and reporting  
- Deployment-ready architecture (FastAPI, testing, CI/CD ready)

---

## Goals
- Understand engine degradation through sensor behavior analysis  
- Engineer labels for **RUL prediction** and **failure classification**  
- Benchmark baseline models and compare with advanced ML methods  
- Build a clean, reproducible pipeline suitable for deployment  
- Demonstrate good MLOps practices (experiment tracking, modular repo, testing)
