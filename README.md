predictive_maintenance
==============================
Project Overview:

This project focuses on developing a predictive maintenance solution for jet engines using the NASA CMAPSS (Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation) dataset. The primary objective is to build machine learning models that accurately estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of engines based on sensor data collected over their operational cycles.

Key aims include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand sensor behaviors and identify meaningful patterns related to engine degradation.
- Engineering robust labels and features to enable both regression (predicting RUL) and classification (predicting imminent failure) tasks.
- Developing and evaluating baseline and advanced predictive models.
- Structuring the project with sound engineering practices and reproducibility to facilitate future extension and deployment.

The project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of end-to-end machine learning pipeline development within the predictive maintenance domain.
